# Dyligent
For Anti-Procrastination

### The Purpose & The Function
With the COVID crisis, studying and working remotely from home has become much more prevalent. 
Despite all the perks of remote learning and working, we find ourselves more distracted than ever and we struggle to keep ourselves away from such distractions and the temptation to procrastinate. 

Dyligent is a chrome extension + a webapp designed to keep us focused and productive. 

With Dyligent, the user can set certain websites as either completely prohibited, blocking access to the website(s) entirely, or as limited, enabling the user to access the website(s) only for a certain amount of time as specified by the user. Furthermore, Dyligent keeps track of the registered users' (who have consented with sharing their data) screen time on different websites and this data is stored in the server so that it can be accessed and viewed by the user at any time on the Dyligent webapp. The server can store up to two week's usage history and the webapp uses the data to generate clean and organized graphs so that the user will be able to clearly see and analyze his or her usage of the web.

### Scope
This is a multi-part project involving making both a browser extension and a webapp that works hand-in-hand with the extension.

The chrome extension part of the project will monitor and limit the user's access to certain websites, as specified by the user. For registered users who have consented with providing their data, the extension will also monitor the user's screen time on different websites and send that data to a server to store. Using the data stored in the server, the webapp part of the project will authenticate the user and provide the appropriate screen time data of the user in the form of clean and organized graphs for easier viewing and analysis. 

There should be more than enough work to be done in implementing and deploying this project, so much so that there may even be the need to give up certain aspects of the proposed project to meet the deadline (e.g. only creating the extension to block/limit certain websites and not creating the webapp and the server to store the data).
